(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:IBM&action=purge)  · Updated 2015-01-08    Is it
encyclopedic to refer to IBM employees as IBMers throughout the article? To an outsider this seems
distracting and unnecessary, bordering on WP:PROMOTION (/wiki/Wikipedia:PROMOTION) , when the more
straightforward "IBM employees" would do just fine. The article on Google (/wiki/Google) for example
doesn't use the term "Googlers" at all. Is there any MoS guideline we can turn to for this?

observation. I'm not sure about a guideline, but I was surprised by a cursory search and the number
of sources that refer to them as IMBers Troubadour34

which was a cybersecurity company founded in Fredericton, New Brunswick. It redirected here, which
makes sense as it was later bought out by IBM, but there’s no information on this page about Q1
labs. There’s definitely info out there - there’s a decent amount on the page for Brendan Hannigan,
one of the founders - but I’m not sure where that should be aggregated 130.113.109.111

ago, because I don't think it's informative. IBM is quite spread out globally and not much of its
personnel is actually located there. On top of that, it's a pretty bad picture with a tree blocking
the view of the building. @ User:Farzam.akbarian86 (/wiki/User:Farzam.akbarian86) added back the
picture. Can we reach a consensus on what to do here? PhotographyEdits (/wiki/User:PhotographyEdits)

about exceptional contributors, are both out of place and don't belong in the history section,
particularly in the area between the 30's and 50's. They have nothing to do with the history of IBM
